# antares-brinkerink-2015
R implementation of an Antares adaptation of the 2020 paper, "Building and Calibrating a Country-Level Detailed Global Electricity Model Based on Public Data", by Brinkerink et al. An attempted model of the electricity production and consumption in 2015.

(NB : file sizes make it impossible to import the Antares and input folders, so an installation/setup guide should be done)
